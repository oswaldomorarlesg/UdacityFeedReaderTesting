## Project Instruction:

> In this project, you will be learning about testing with Javascript. Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard known as "test-driven development" or TDD. This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application .

> Whether you work in an organization that writes tests extensively to inform product development or one that uses tests to encourage iteration, testing has become an essential skill in modern web development.

> ## Intentional test for code failure
- __Error Test__ (https://github.com/oswaldomorarlesg/UdacityFeedReaderTesting/blob/master/errortest.JPG)

> ## Correct Tests
- I added a new feed variable in ./js/app.js.

### I performed the following tests to meet the requirements of the project:
- Tests to confirm that the allFeeds objects has been defined and that it is not empty.

- Tests to confirm that each feed in the allFeeds object and ensure that it has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.

- Tests to confirm that each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures that it has a defined name and that the name is not empty.

- Tests to confirm that the item is hidden by default.

- Tests to confirm that you have the menu changes visibility when the menu is clicked.

- Tests to confirm that the loadFeed function is called and complete its work, and there is at least a single entry element within the feed container.

- Tests to confirm that the content actually changes when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function.
